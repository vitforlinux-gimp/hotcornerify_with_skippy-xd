# hotcornerify_with_skippy-xd
This script is for Antix or Debian based distro, not for Ubuntu.
bl-hotcorners-python3 is not in this repo

But in this https://github.com/capn-damo/scripts/blob/master/bl-hotcorners-python3

the deb package is in Antix repo, for Debian is downloaded with wget.

File ~/.config/bl-hotcorners/bl-hotcornersrc is automatically created.

In Debian need add manually bl-hotcorners-python3 -d to autostart session, not in Antix.
